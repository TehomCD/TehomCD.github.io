	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>After graduating college with a degree in software engineering, I wound up in an unrelated field - 
  I worked for quite some time as a professional gambler. A very mediocre professional gambler. I found
  that spending massive amounts of time and effort on things without much to show for it wasn't really
  for me, and decided to get back to my roots with coding, which always made me happy. The problem I 
  faced is that my technical knowledge was badly out of date, and I've spent the past two years learning
  python, javascript, and other things related to full-stack web development.</p>
